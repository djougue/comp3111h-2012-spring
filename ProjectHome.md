“What to Eat in UST?”

This is an eternal question for all students, faculties and staff on our campus. It is common that people stand around the recipe board at LG7 for over 5 minutes without a clue. To help answer it, an Android application **ezMeal** (pronounced “easy meal”) is developed.


**ezMeal** is a dinning guide designed specifically for people studying or working in HKUST. It offers recipes of restaurants on campus, classifies food according to their tastes and prices, generates a popularity ranking, and enables users to choose what to eat based on the dishes review written by other UST students and faculties.


Besides all the functionality mentioned above, a brand new feature “SHAKE” is introduced for those who have a hard time making decision on food. When the user “SHAKE”s the cell phone, **ezMeal** automatically recommends a dish for you based on the popularity of all dishes, the price, dietary restrictions, and even your personal taste. Through this intelligent food recommendation engine, users can also “like” or “dislike” a dish. This would change the rankings of all the food, and helps the engine to make a more personalized recommendation for the user next time.
