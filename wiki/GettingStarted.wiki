#summary How to install Eclipse, Android SDK and SVN; Check-out and check-in issues.

= Getting Started =

This Android project is implemented using Eclipse, with Android SDK plug-in. Also, we use Subversion (SVN) as the repository. This Wiki article explains how to install Eclipse and configure it.


== Downloading Eclipse ==

Eclipse can be downloaded from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/. "Eclipse Classic" version is recommended. Otherwise, "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" version is recommended.

== Downloading Android SDK ==
Android SDK can be downloaded from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html.
  * For Windows users, Android SDK can be installed directly by the installer.
  * For Mac OS X and Linux users, please go to "tool" directory, and run "android" binary file to open the SDK Manager. Then install the newest version of Android platform under the instructions.

== Installing ADT Plugin for Eclipse ==
  # Start Eclipse, then select Help > Install New Software....
  # Click Add, in the top-right corner.
  # In the Add Repository dialog that appears, enter "ADT Plugin" for the Name and the following URL for the Location: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/
  # Click OK
     Note: If you have trouble acquiring the plugin, try using "http" in the Location URL, instead of "https" (https is preferred for security reasons).
  # In the Available Software dialog, select the checkbox next to Developer Tools and click Next.
  # In the next window, you'll see a list of the tools to be downloaded. Click Next.
  # Read and accept the license agreements, then click Finish.
     Note: If you get a security warning saying that the authenticity or validity of the software can't be established, click OK.
  # When the installation completes, restart Eclipse.
  # A window will pop out automatically when you restart Eclipse. Choose "Using Existing SDK Location", and browse the directory of Android SDK which you downloaded just now.
